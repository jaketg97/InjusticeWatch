I've since updated this analysis on my personal GitHub; I highly encourage you to use/cite my updated work as opposed to this dated code. You can find all relevant files/code at https://github.com/jaketg97/Jacob-Toner-Gosselin/tree/main/cook_county_sentencing. You can find a summary of my work at https://jaketg97.github.io/Jacob-Toner-Gosselin/cook_county_sentencing/judging_judges.
